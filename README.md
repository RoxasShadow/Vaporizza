Vaporizza
=========
Vaporize all your desktop icons!

Just a pretty Windows Gadget which displays and allows to run a list of your Steam games on your desktop.

Installation
--------------

- Be sure your Steam profile is public
- Go in your Steam path (usually `C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\` or `C:\Program Files\Steam\`) and create here a text file called `userid.txt`
- Go in your Steam profile, paste in `userid.txt` your userID (`http://steamcommunity.com/id/HappyUser/` => `HappyUser`) and save it
- Download from the [Downloads] section the latest Vaporizza and rename it as `Vaporizza.gadget`
- Install the gadget just clicking on it
- Click the right mouse button on the desktop -> View -> Show Desktop Gadgets
- ???
- Profit!

In order to add some applications in Steam (Origin, uPlay, free-DRM games and whatever), just `Steam -> Games -> Add a non steam game to my library`.

To add them on Vaporizza, run (and/or copy it in the Windows startup folder) `tools/SteamShortcutsToXML.exe`.

If you want to get the source of SteamShortcutsToXML, just search it through my repositories.
