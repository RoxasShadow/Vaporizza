Vaporize all your desktop icons!
Just a pretty gadget for Windows 7 which displays and allows to run a list of your Steam games on your desktop.

HOWTO install:
  Be sure your Steam profile is public;
  Go in your Steam path (usually C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\ or C:\Program Files\Steam\) and create here a text file called 'userid.txt';
  Go in your Steam profile, paste in 'userid.txt' your userID (http://steamcommunity.com/id/HappyUser/ => HappyUser) and save it;
  Install the gadget just clicking on it;
  Click the right mouse button on the desktop -> View -> Show Desktop Gadgets;
  ???
  Profit!

In order to add some applications in Steam (Origin, uPlay, free-DRM games and whatever), just Steam -> Games -> Add a non steam game to my library.
To add them on Vaporizza, run (and/or copy it in the Windows startup folder) tools/SteamShortcutsToXML.exe.
If you want to get the source of SteamShortcutsToXML, just search it through my repositories.
